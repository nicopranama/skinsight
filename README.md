# SkinSight â€“ Skin Type Classification using ResNet50

**SkinSight** is a deep learning project that uses **ResNet50** to classify skin types from images.  
This project leverages **transfer learning** to achieve high accuracy in predicting skin categories such as **Oily**, **Dry**, **Normal**, and **Combination** skin.
